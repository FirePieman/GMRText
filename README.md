# GMRText
A java based text notifier for http://multiplayerrobot.com/ 

## Why I'm working on this now ##
This was a project I started in high school. It functions, but I wanted to add it to Git, clean up the code and add some additional features.

## Longer description ##
Giant Multiplayer Robot is a multiplayer service for Sid Meier's Civilization V which handles passing your games' save files from player to
player. It provides desktop notifications and email notifications, however these were not enough for my friends who would still fail to do 
there turn in a reasonable amount of time. So I thought, why not write an application that would text my friends when it was there turn, 
and give them reminders when there turn was about to get skipped.

## Usage Instructions ##
